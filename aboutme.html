   <p>Hello. My name is Ethan Lundsten. I am 20 years old and a sophmore, going on junior, at URI. I was born on Long Island, New York and lived there for a chunk of my life.
    I then moved to North Carolina for a couple of years before ultimately ending up in Rhode Island. I finished High school in Rhode Island and attended CCRI for the first two years of University. 
    I transfered to URI to pursue a computer science major and possibly a minor in buisness or finance. I love computers and technology so coding and programming really peaked my interest.
